"""A stand-in for radio-browser.info, for script/test-radiobrowser.sh.

Serves a fixed, deliberately awkward station list: bitrates as numbers, a
station with no bitrate field at all, and one whose bitrate is a string. Those
three shapes are what the filtering code has to survive -- comparing a JSON
number against '' is what used to raise "Invalid variant type cast" and take
the process down with a double free.

    mock-radiobrowser.py <port> [mode]

modes:  ok (default) | empty | malformed

Set RB_LOG to a file path and every request line is appended to it, query
string included. That is the only way to assert on what Retuner *asked* for
rather than what it did with the answer -- ordering is a property of the
upstream query, and it is invisible in the response the mock sends back.
