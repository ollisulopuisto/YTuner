"""Stands in for GitHub's release endpoints, for script/test-update.sh.

    mock-release.py <port> <version> <dir-with-assets> [digest-mode]

Serves the three things the updater asks for:

    /<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest                     -> 302 to the tag URL
    /<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/v<ver>/<asset>    -> the file
    /<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/v<ver>/SHA256SUMS -> the checksums

digest-mode is "good" (the real sha256), "bad" (a wrong one, so the updater
must refuse) or "none" (no SHA256SUMS published at all, which must not stop
it - releases made before that file existed have none).

The checksums come from a published file rather than the REST API because the
API has no per-asset digest. The first version of this served one in JSON, and
so tested a field GitHub does not send.
