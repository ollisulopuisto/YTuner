# Runs *inside* the built add-on image, mounted in by CI. It lives in a file
# rather than inline in the workflow because an inline `sh -c '...'` payload is
# one apostrophe away from silently ending early: a comment reading "s6's first
# wave" once closed the quote, and the assertions after it ran on the CI runner
# instead of in the container -- which fails with no output at all.
#
# The binary is a server and would never exit, so it is not started here. That
# it is present, executable and has every shared library it needs is what this
# can prove; script/smoke-test.sh covers it running.
