# Country presets

A preset is a short, curated station list for one country. Retuner fetches the
file for each country you configure and merges it into the "My stations" menu,
so a new install has something worth listening to before anyone edits a config
file.

```
presets/fi.ini      ->  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ollisulopuisto/retuner/master/presets/fi.ini
```

The file name is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, lowercased. The format is
exactly `stations.ini`, so anything you can put in your own station list works
here:

```ini
[National]
Some National Station=https://stream.example/live.mp3|https://example/logo.png

[Regional]
Some Regional Station=https://stream.example/regional.mp3
```

## What belongs in one

**A broadcaster's own published stream, and not much else.** Warner Music & Sony
Music v TuneIn [2021] EWCA Civ 441 turned on who is making the communication to
the public. A geo-scoped list pointing at streams a broadcaster already
publishes for its own audience keeps this a convenience for listeners. A list
that aggregates other people's catalogues, or that re-points streams through
somewhere they were not meant to go, does not.

Concretely:

- **Yes**: the national broadcaster's radio channels, commercial stations that
  publish a direct stream, community stations that want to be found.
- **No**: streams lifted from an aggregator, streams behind a login, streams a
  broadcaster restricts by geography (they will fail for most listeners
  anyway), and anything you cannot point at a public page for.
- Keep it short. Twenty good stations beat two hundred, because the person
  browsing has a jog dial and a two-line display.

## Adding or updating one

Generate a starting point, which connects to every candidate and keeps only the
ones that actually serve audio:

```sh
./script/make-preset.py --country fi --out presets/fi.ini
```

Then **edit it**. The generator is good at proving a URL plays and bad at
knowing whether a station belongs in a national preset — it sorts by
click-count and groups by whatever tag radio-browser happens to carry. Rename
the categories to something a person would recognise, drop the noise, and put
the broadcaster's own channels first.

If you cannot reach radio-browser from where you are, the
`Build a country preset` workflow does the same thing on a GitHub runner and
uploads the result for you to review:
Actions → Build a country preset → Run workflow → enter a country code.

To re-check a file that has been sitting for a while and drop what has gone
dead:

```sh
./script/make-preset.py --prune presets/fi.ini
```

## The weekly re-check

`.github/workflows/preset-refresh.yml` runs every Monday, connects to every
stream in every file here, and opens a pull request if anything changed. It
never commits to master: what belongs in a national preset is the judgement
this whole file is about, and a stream can stop answering for reasons that have
nothing to do with the station being gone.

That last point is why the weekly run does not use plain `--prune`, which drops
a station the first time it fails to answer. One CDN hiccup at 04:00 on a
Sunday would otherwise delete a national broadcaster with nobody watching.
Instead:

```sh
./script/make-preset.py --prune presets/fi.ini --strikes presets/strikes.json
```

A failure is recorded rather than acted on, and a station is dropped only after
three consecutive weekly failures (`--strike-limit`). A run in which it plays
clears its record, so three failures spread over a year never add up to a
removal; the record is held against the URL, so fixing a broken link by hand
does not inherit the old one's strikes.

`presets/strikes.json` is that record, and is carried in the same pull request.
It is rebuilt from scratch on each run, so a station you delete by hand leaves
nothing behind. Nothing reads it at runtime — Retuner never sees it.

In the pull request, `warn` lines are a watchlist and `drop` lines are
removals. Check a dropped station before merging: a stream can refuse a
datacentre in particular, and a broadcaster that has moved its URL wants the
new one rather than deleting the entry.

## How Retuner uses them

Set the countries in the add-on's configuration, or in `retuner.ini`:

```ini
[Presets]
Enable=1
PresetsCountries=fi,se
```

At startup Retuner fetches each file, validates that it parses and contains at
least one http(s) URL, and only then replaces its cached copy in
`config/presets/`. A fetch that fails leaves the previous copy in place, so a
network problem costs you yesterday's list rather than the whole menu. Your own
`stations.ini` is always loaded first and always wins: a category that appears
in both is merged, not duplicated, and a station you already have is not added
twice.
